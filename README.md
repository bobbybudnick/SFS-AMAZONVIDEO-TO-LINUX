# SFS-AMAZONVIDEO-TO-LINUX
This script creates an interface for local viewing of Amazon Video.

At some point Amazon Video stopped working at 1080p mode on my Linux media laptop.

This was needed to watch in HD on the laptop again.

The purpose of the script is not for recording video but only playing back.
