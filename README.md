# SFS-AMAZONVIDEO-TO-LINUX
This script creates an interface for local viewing of Amazon Video.

This uses VLC to display input from your capture device.

It also sends remote control commands to the Fire Stick using your keyboard.

At some point Amazon Video stopped working at 1080p mode on my Linux media laptop browser.

This was needed to watch in HD on the laptop again.

The outline, or design document is included which overviews how the process works.

Additionally an alternative control method using infrared is covered in the document.

The Android Debug Bridge platform-tools folder must be installed in home for keyboard controls to function.

Playback should be full speed but the keyboard interface is slow - please be patient.

The biggest problem it has right now is continuous or intermittent audio dropouts.

The purpose of the script is not for recording video but only playing back.
